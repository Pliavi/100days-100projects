# Pug+Tailwind CSS Parcel Starter Project

- This is an example of a super simple Parcel setup for using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
- Also using using [Pug](https://devhints.io/pug).
- Thsi is an extended version of [clupprich's repo](https://github.com/clupprich/tailwind-parcel).

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

After that, start up Parcel:

```
npm run serve
```

### Hints:
- separator has been changed from ':' to '_' and '/' to 'o' because of pug limitations.
    a responsive width class becomes lg_w-1o3
- because of css plugins, you'll will have to refresh/save master.css anytime you add a new class to the markup (you're css file will be incredibly small eventually)
